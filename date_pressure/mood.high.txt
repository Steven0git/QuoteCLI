Never let yourself be saddened by a separation
Accept everything just the way it is
Do not seek pleasure for its own sake
Resentment and complaint are appropriate neither for oneself nor others
Do not let yourself be guided by the feeling of lust or love
Do not act following customary beliefs
Never stray from the Way
Man is Condemned to be Free.
There are always those who cannot let go of their past.
Only Courage in face doubt can lead one to the answer
It is indeed a precious gift to understand the forces that guide oneself.
Celebrate life grandeur, It's brilliance, It's magnificence
A Man is a Wolf to Another Man
The Tower of Demise marks is the beginning of the End for all living things...even you...
Making the wisest of decisions requires one to escape from the desires of temptation
In the face of disaster lies opportunity for renewal
The silent voice within ones heart whispers the most profound wisdom
To Work You Have The Right, But Not To Fruits Thereof
We Never Forget What We Endeavor to Forget
The Strongest Principle of Growth Lies in the Human Choice
If You Make a Mistake and Do Not Correct It, This Is Called a Mistake.
Remember to Keep a Clear Head in Difficult Times
Do not collect weapons or practice with weapons beyond what is useful
You may abandon your own body but you must preserve your honor
