The line between failure and success is so fine that we scarcely know when we pass it — so fine that we are often on the line and do not know it.

In business sometimes prospects may seem darkest when really they are on the turn. A little more persistence, a little more effort, and what seemed hopeless failure may turn to glorious success. There is no failure except in no longer trying. There is no defeat except from within, no really insurmountable barrier save our own inherent weakness of purpose."
"Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement; nothing can be done without hope."
