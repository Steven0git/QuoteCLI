“One should guard against preaching to young people success in the customary form as the main aim in life. The most important motive for work in school and in life is pleasure in work, pleasure in its result, and the knowledge of the value of the result to the community.” 
“Do not judge men by mere appearances; for the light laughter that bubbles on the lip often mantles over the depths of sadness, and the serious look may be the sober veil that covers a divine peace and joy.”
"The best code isn't just functional, it's elegant. It reads like prose, sings like poetry, and solves problems like a master chef."  
"Quality code isn't an accident, it's a result of intention, discipline, and a relentless pursuit of excellence."  
"Just as a sculptor removes excess stone to reveal the hidden statue within, a great coder removes unnecessary code to reveal the elegance of the solution."  
"Learning to code is about more than syntax; it's about learning to think clearly, solve problems creatively, and build things that matter."   
"The quality of your code reflects the quality of your mind. Strive for clarity, efficiency, and maintainability."  
"Don't just write code, craft experiences. Every line of code should contribute to a seamless and delightful user interaction."  
"Good code is like a good explanation - it should be clear, concise, and easy to understand."  
"Testing isn't about finding bugs, it's about building confidence in the quality and reliability of your code." 
"Legacy code isn't an excuse for poor quality. Refactoring and continuous improvement are essential for maintaining a sustainable codebase." 
"The true cost of code isn't just in writing it, but in maintaining it. Write code for the future, with an eye towards readability and maintainability."  
"Focus on building things that work, but never lose sight of building things well. Quality matters in the long run." -  Steve McConnell
"Learning to code opens doors to a world of possibilities, but it's the pursuit of quality that unlocks its true potential." 
"The difference between a good coder and a great coder is the relentless pursuit of quality. Every line, every function, a testament to excellence."  
"Don't be afraid to break things, but always strive to leave them better than you found them. Quality code is an ongoing journey, not a destination." 
"Community is key in coding. Learn from the best, share your knowledge, and together we can elevate the overall quality of code."  
"Coding standards aren't meant to stifle creativity, but to ensure consistency and maintain a high level of code quality across projects."  
"Readability is a fundamental quality of good code. Write code for humans to understand, not just the compiler."  
"Coding with quality in mind is an investment. It might take longer initially, but pays off with fewer bugs, easier maintenance, and a more sustainable system."  
"Complexity is the enemy of quality. Break down problems into smaller, well-defined functions to create clean, maintainable code."  
"Never stop learning. The world of coding is constantly evolving, and the pursuit of quality requires a commitment to continuous improvement."  
“Beware of the man who works hard to learn something, learns it, and finds himself no wiser than before... He is full of murderous resentment of people who are ignorant without having come by their ignorance the hard way.”
“Practical wisdom is only to be learned in the school of experience. Precepts and instruction are useful so far as they go, but, without the discipline of real life, they remain of the nature of theory only.”
